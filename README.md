# Transcend Grounded

At some point in my studies on mobile apps I would need to develop something, well, here we are.

React Native mobile app, consuming data from one (or more) API to display the content in the tabs. Initially one screen to list the content, one to consume the content.
Modular and Scalable? I hope so, but phase one is more about making it work.

### What about the future? 

"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but, today is a gift. thats why is called the present". Okay and?
- Play third-party content in the app. (like a YouTube video)

### The Name

TranscendGrounded: It may initially seem like something mystical, motivational and linked to nature. But that's not it, the idea is to be transformed by God with our feet on his principles, "Grounded". (Clearly a personal project)

24 "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock.
25 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it didnâ€™t fall, for it was founded on the rock.

Thoughts, Philosophy, Reflections, something very close to theology, and a little far from a devotional (maybe).
